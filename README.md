# PyYoutubeDownloader
A simple console driven youtube downloader written in python!

The script lets you download youtube audio/video content, letting you choose the desired resolution. Audio might not be "present" in some streams of a certain resolution and I didn't want to limit the download to the highest resolution with included audio. The script thus uses ffmpeg (required!) framework to merge video with audio when it is not included in the stream.

I am not a python programmer, I just play with it a bit. Every tip and correction are welcome!

** DISCLAIMER **
Downloading youtube videos is against Youtube Policy and violates several Copyright laws. This script has a demonstration purpose and I am not responsible of its usage.
