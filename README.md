# PyYoutubeDownloader
A simple command prompt youtube downloader written in python!

The script lets you download audio/video content from Youtube, choosing the desired resolution. Audio might not be "present" in some streams for a certain resolution and I didn't want to limit the download to the highest resolution with audio included. The script thus uses ffmpeg (required!) framework to merge video and audio when it is not included in the video stream.

I am not a python programmer, I just play with it a bit. Every tip and correction are welcome!

Downloading youtube videos is against Youtube Policy and violates several Copyright laws. This script has a demonstration purpose and I am not responsible of its usage.
